# Coffee Budget Backend

A NestJS backend for a personal finance management application.

## Project Structure

This is a multi-repository project with the following structure:

```
coffee-budget-backend/          # This repository (Backend API)
├── src/                       # Source code
├── docs/                      # Documentation
├── coffee-budget.code-workspace # VS Code workspace configuration
└── ...

coffee-budget-frontend/        # Frontend repository (separate folder)
├── src/                       # React/Next.js frontend
└── ...
```

To work with both frontend and backend:
1. Open the `coffee-budget.code-workspace` file in VS Code
2. This will load both the backend and frontend as separate workspace folders

```json
{
  "transaction_ids": [1, 2, 3, 4],
